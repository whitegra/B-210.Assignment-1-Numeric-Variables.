Program Purpose: 

The purpose of this program is to allow users to calculate the minimum amount of currency needed to complete a transaction, and to convert from one temperature to another. This program allows users to chose their desired calculations in a loop, so users are able to preform both calulations without exiting the program. 

Inputs: 
- entire program:
  - type of calculation ( 'c' = change, 't' = temp)
  - preform another calculation ('y'/'n')
  - exit program ('e')
    
- change calculator: 
  -  tendered amount
  -  cost of item(s)
    
- temperature converter:
  -  starting temperature 
  -  starting temperature unit ('c' = celcius, 'k' = kelvins, 'f' = farenheit)
  -  desired conversion unit ('c' = celcius, 'k' = kelvins, 'f' = farenheit)

Expected output: 
  depending on the users choice of calculation: 
  - if ('c'): this will output the minimum amount of currency needed to complete the transaction. 
  - if ('t'): this will output the user's temperature converted to the scale of their choice. 
  - if ('s'): the program will end. 

 Types of execution: 
  - Repeated execution: this program utilizes for and while loops in order to re-execute the program based on user input.
  - Sequential: calculations are preformed from top to bottom within each calculation.
  - Conditional Execution: if else statements are utilized to determine proper calculations based on the user's input. 
  - Reusable: functions are reusable within the code, they can be repeated if the user choses to do so. 

Possible improvements: 
1. Enhancing the program's ability to handle errors, possibly making instructions more clear.
2. Providing a better user interface by displaying results in a visually clearer way.
3. Enhancing the program's calculation abilities so that calculations can be preformed interchangably between float and int inputs.
4. Better organization of the output results.
